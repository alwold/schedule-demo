This is a demo for the 2010 ASU Java Day event.  It demonstrates how to use Spring JDBC to access data in
a Peoplesoft database.  It includes a set of unit tests using Derby with schema/data exported from a real
Peoplesoft database.  The web app also works against the derby database, so it doesn't require an actual
Peoplesoft installation to play with it.
